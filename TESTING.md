# Phase A Manual Checklist

- [ ] Fresh incognito session loads demo data (or empty state) without console errors.
- [ ] Toggle Admin mode prompts for passcode; setting passcode works; enabling/disabling works.
- [ ] Log an inter-office move with shipping fields and confirm no regressions.
- [ ] Moves tab shows equipment names correctly (not `Unknown equipment`).
- [ ] Import template downloads and import preview/apply work.
- [ ] No forced `Leave site?` dialogs and no tab/window closes triggered by app code.
